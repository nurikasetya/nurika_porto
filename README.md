## ðŸ“‚ Projects
- ðŸ“Š [Student Union Sustainability Dashboard](https://github.com/nurikasetya/SUdashboard.git)
During my masterâ€™s studies, I worked part-time as a Data Analyst using Power BI to support the Students' Unionâ€™s sustainability initiatives. I was responsible for building and maintaining interactive dashboards that visualised key sustainability indicators aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of my main contributions was the Waste Reduction Dashboard, which tracked usage of printing paper, office materials, and related KPIs against the Unionâ€™s 2027 targets. My work enabled clear performance tracking, strategic reporting, and data-driven decision-making by senior leadership.

- ðŸ“Š [Student Union Ops KPI Dashboard](https://github.com/nurikasetya/SUdashboard_OpsKPI.git)
As a part-time Power BI Data Analyst, I contributed to the development of an internal dashboard for the Research and Insight Department. The goal was to support evidence-based decision-making by decentralising data collection and embedding real-time KPIs across departments. My tasks included building visual performance trackers, integrating survey results, and highlighting operational objectives in line with organisational values such as transparency, student-centricity, and improvement & progression. This dashboard enhanced visibility for cross-departmental goals and was aligned with strategic themes like enhancing student support.
