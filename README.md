During my master’s studies, I worked part-time as a Data Analyst using Power BI to support the Students' Union’s sustainability initiatives. I was responsible for building and maintaining interactive dashboards that visualised key sustainability indicators aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of my main contributions was the Waste Reduction Dashboard, which tracked usage of printing paper, office materials, and related KPIs against the Union’s 2027 targets. My work enabled clear performance tracking, strategic reporting, and data-driven decision-making by senior leadership.
